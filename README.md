# HiTail

Your neighborhood catsitting app. This application allows users to request catsitting from their neighbors, and book a catsitting for their neighbors. HiTail features a dashboard that displays requests the user has made, and requests the user has accepted. Requests made by the user dynamically display the user's cat(s) information from their profile. All users may peruse the available requests board and accept requests by their neighbors.
